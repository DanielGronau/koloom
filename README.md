# koloom

Koloom is a DSL for writing Kotlin code (e.g. for automatic code generation). The leading solution for this task is the kotlin-poet library, which I highly recommend for serious applications. However, the syntax of this library is very similar to the java-poet sister project, and uses a similar JAva-oriented DSL. Kotlin can do so much more. This project tries to create a better DSL by harnessing the power of Kotlin.
